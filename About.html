2013–2015: Formation and debut
JYPE founder J. Y. Park is credited with creating the group's name

On December 19, 2013, JYP Entertainment (JYPE) announced that they would debut a new girl group in the first half of 2014, the first female group to come out of the company since the debut of Miss A in 2010.[3] On February 27, 2014, JYPE trainees Lena and Cecilia were confirmed as members of the group tentatively called as 6MIX, while other rumored members included JYPE trainees Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Jihyo (then known as Jisoo) and Minyoung.[4][5] The group's debut plan was eventually canceled when Lena and Cecilia left the company.[6]
On February 11, 2015, J. Y. Park, the founder of JYPE, announced that the lineup of the upcoming seven-member girl group would be decided through Sixteen, a competition survival show that would air on Mnet later that year.[7] The show began on May 5 and ended on July 7 with Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun, and Chaeyoung being selected as the seven Twice members. Park then announced that he would increase the size of the group from seven members to nine by adding Tzuyu, who was known as the "audience's pick" since she was the most popular contestant by the show's end, and Momo, who was added by Park himself since he felt the group needed someone with Momo's performance abilities. The decision was controversial at the time, with many people complaining about eliminated contestants being able to join the group.[8][9][10] The group's name, Twice, was chosen by Park, explaining that "the group will touch people's hearts twice: once through the ears, and once again through the eyes."[11] Fans of Twice are known as "Once", commonly stylized as ONCE, illustrated by the members' statement "If you love us even once, we will repay your love with twice of our love" on social media in 2015.[12][13]
Twice made their official debut on October 20, 2015, with the release of their debut EP The Story Begins, simultaneously with its lead single "Like Ooh-Ahh" alongside a live showcase to promote it.[14][15] The group initially received a lukewarm reception; while their EP debuted at number 4 on the Gaon Album Chart for the week ending October 24 before peaking at number 3 two weeks later,[16][17] its lead single "Like Ooh-Ahh" met moderate success debuting at number 22 on the Gaon Digital Chart.[18] A week after its release, the single dropped to number 57 on South Korea's largest music site Melon, but through word of mouth from netizens regarding the group's subsequent promotions and performances, "Like Ooh-Ahh" reached within the top 10 of various Korean music charts including Melon, Genie, and Naver Music by November 15. Such a reverse run on music charts by a rookie girl group was deemed unusual by Korean media.[19][20] Eventually, "Like Ooh-Ahh" would reach its peak position of number 10 on the Gaon Digital Chart, three months after the song's original release.[21] The music video for the group's single hit 50 million views on YouTube within five months of their debut and became one of the most-viewed debut music videos for any K-pop group.[22][23] The group's early success earned them a "Best New Female Artist" award at the 2015 Mnet Asian Music Awards held on December 2.[24] On December 27, Twice performed a remix version of their single "Like Ooh-Ahh" at SBS Gayo Daejeon, which was the group's first-ever attendance on a year-end music program.[25][26]</p>

Eventually, Twicecoaster: Lane 1 became the bestselling K-pop girl group album for 2016, selling 350,852 copies at year-end.[46][47] Its lead single "TT" became one of the best-performing songs in 2016, claiming the top spot of the Gaon Digital Chart for four consecutive weeks and becoming the best-performing single in South Korea for the month of November.[48] Internationally, the group's third EP debuted at number 3 on Billboard's World Album chart, marking their first Top 5 entry, with the album's lead single "TT" debuting at number 2 on Billboard's World Digital Song Sales chart.[39] "TT" then became the first music video by a K-pop female act to surpass 200 million views on May 25, 2017.[49]

Twice released their first full-length Korean album, Twicetagram, on October 30 with its lead single titled "Likey".

Several composers and songwriters participated in the making of this album, including the Korean members of Twice as lyricists and former Wonder Girls member Hyerim, who co-composed the eighth track titled "Look at Me".[86][87][88] The album and its lead single debuted atop both Billboard's World Albums and World Digital Song Sales respectively—the group's first number one on both charts, making Twice the first female K-pop act to simultaneously top both Billboard charts. They also rose on the Heatseekers Albums chart as the album debuted at number 10, one position higher than Signal's peak at number 11.[89]
